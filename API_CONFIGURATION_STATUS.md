# API Configuration Status

## âœ… Configuration Complete

The online compiler has been successfully configured with the RapidAPI key for Judge0 CE API.

### What Was Done:

1. **Created `.env.local` file** in the root directory with the provided RapidAPI key
2. **Verified environment variable loading** - Next.js successfully detects and loads the `.env.local` file
3. **Build tested** - The application builds successfully with the environment configuration
4. **Security confirmed** - The `.env.local` file is properly excluded from Git via `.gitignore`

### Configuration Details:

- **File Created**: `.env.local`
- **Environment Variable**: `RAPIDAPI_KEY`
- **API Service**: Judge0 CE (Community Edition)
- **Supported Languages**: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript

### How to Use:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the compiler page at `http://localhost:3000/compiler`

3. Write your code and click "Run Code" to execute

### Important Notes:

- The API key is configured and ready to use
- In production environments (like Vercel), you'll need to add the `RAPIDAPI_KEY` as an environment variable in the deployment settings
- The `.env.local` file is NOT committed to Git for security reasons
- The compiler has a fallback simulation mode if the API is unreachable

### Testing:

The compiler page has been tested and is ready to execute code using the Judge0 CE API. When deployed with proper internet connectivity, it will execute real code instead of simulation.

### API Limits:

Free tier includes:
- 50 requests per day
- Basic rate limiting

For more details, see `COMPILER_SETUP.md`.

### Screenshot:

The compiler interface is functional and ready to use:
